# Contributing to project-starter

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (if available).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Send that pull request!


## Report bugs using Github Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/developersIndia/); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

<!-- If you are the maintainer list the guidelines below, links, resources everything -->
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
